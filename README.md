## Installation

```bash
go get -u github.com/elliotchance/dingo
```

## Building the Container

Building or rebuilding the container is done with:

```bash
dingo
```

The container is created from a file called `dingo.yml` in the same directory as
where the `dingo` command is run. This should be the root of your
module/repository.

Here is an example of a `dingo.yml`:

```yml
services:
  SendEmail:
    type: *SendEmail
    interface: EmailSender
    properties:
      From: '"hi@welcome.com"'

  CustomerWelcome:
    type: *CustomerWelcome
    returns: NewCustomerWelcome(@SendEmail)
```

It will generate a file called `dingo.go`. This must be committed with your
code.

## Configuring Services

The `dingo.yml` is described below:

```yml
services:
  # Describes each of the services. The name of the service follow the same
  # naming conventions as Go, so service names that start with a capital letter
  # will be exported (available outside this package).
  SendEmail:
  
    # Required: You must provide either 'type' or 'interface'.

    # Optional: The type returned by the `return` expression. You must provide a
    # fully qualified name that includes the package name if the type does not
    # belong to this package. For example:
    #
    #   type: '*github.com/go-redis/redis.Options'
    #
    type: *SendEmail
    
    # Optional: If you need to replace this service with another struct type in
    # unit tests you will need to provide an interface. This will override
    # `type` and must be compatible with returned type of `return`.
    interface: EmailSender
    
    # Optional: The expression used to instantiate the service. You can provide
    # any Go code here, including referencing other services and environment
    # variables. Described in more detail below.
    returns: NewSendEmail()
    
    # Optional: If 'returns' provides two arguments (where the second one is the
    # error) you must include an 'error'. This is the expression when
    # "err != nil".
    error: panic(err)
    
    # Optional: If provided, a map of case-sensitive properties to be set on the
    # instance. Each of the properties is Go code and can have the same
    # substitutions described below.
    properties:
      From: "hi@welcome.com"
      maxRetries: 10
      
    # Optional: You can provide explicit imports if you need to reference
    # packages in expressions (such as 'returns') that do not exist 'type' or
    # 'interface'.
    import:
      - 'github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/aws/session'
```

The `returns` and properties can contain any Go code, and allows the following
substitutions:

- `@{SendEmail}` will inject the service named `SendEmail`.
- `${DB_PASS}` will inject the environment variable `DB_PASS`.

## Using Services

As part of the generated file, `dingo.go`. There will be a module-level variable
called `DefaultContainer`. This requires no initialization and can be used
immediately:

```go
func main() {
	welcomer := DefaultContainer.GetCustomerWelcome()
	err := welcomer.Welcome("Bob", "bob@smith.com")
	// ...
}
```

## Unit Testing

**When unit testing you should not use the global `DefaultContainer`.** You
should create a new container:

```go
container := &Container{}
```

Unit tests can make any modifications to the new container, including overriding
services to provide mocks or other stubs:

```go
func TestCustomerWelcome_Welcome(t *testing.T) {
	emailer := FakeEmailSender{}
	emailer.On("Send",
		"bob@smith.com", "Welcome", "Hi, Bob!").Return(nil)
    
	container := &Container{}
	container.SendEmail = emailer
    
	welcomer := container.GetCustomerWelcome()
	err := welcomer.Welcome("Bob", "bob@smith.com")
	assert.NoError(t, err)
	emailer.AssertExpectations(t)
}
```
